For this weeks independent project (6/1/18)
I am creating a website from scratch and showing my ability to use sketch effectively


Images to actual sketches of my work as well as "Sketch" made projects and their prototypes will be included in an Image folder in the root directory.


## Research
  the pictures provided in this fridays prompt kind of helped me steer the color scheme of the site.
  I'm choosing an light almost teal color cause the walls in about every picture is the same color.
  the client wants to be "fun" or "luxurious" I'm going to include every picture in some form on each page to not only accurately portray the environment people will be working in but to also how how luxurious their place is, there will also be mention of special activities held on fridays to show that they're fun.

  Client needs to show they are open to any type of work, not just tech related jobs.
  the type of pictures displayed on the page should be diverse and not always show a computer.


  Site should have a locations link as well as a page for paying for work space.
  contact us will also be its own page.
